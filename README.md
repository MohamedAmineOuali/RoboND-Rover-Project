![alt text][image_0] 

This project is based on the [RoboND-Rover-Project](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Rover-Project) and it will be used to illustrate my solution for perception, decision making and actuation for Roversim.
This file will only document my solution and improvement for this project. For more information about the initial project please check [RoboND-Rover-Project](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Rover-Project)
